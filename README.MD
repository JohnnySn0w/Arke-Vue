# Arke, Vue Edition

## implementing the arke concept in Vue, projectively to port it into a deno-webview rendering window, so that the program itself can maintain standalone nature without the bloat of something like electron.

### The effort of this project is geared towards playing with niche tech, or tech that is new to me
- deno (security oriented js/ts runtime)
- deno-webview(a rust implementation in this case)
- Vue (3, the new hotness in web dev right?)
